    <h2>Exploring the Final Frontier</h2>
    <p>
      Space exploration utilizes astronomy and space technology to investigate outer space. 
      The journey began with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, and reached a major milestone 
      when Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969. Since then, weâ€™ve uncovered the secrets of 
      asteroids, observed distant galaxies, and continue pushing the boundaries of what we know.

            <p>On some missions beyond LEO (Low Earth Orbit), spacecraft are inserted into parking orbits, or lower intermediary orbits. The parking orbit approach greatly simplified Apollo mission planning in several important ways.</p>

            <p>The term "transfer energy" means the total amount of energy imparted by a rocket stage to its payload. This can be the energy imparted by a first stage of a launch vehicle to an upper stage plus payload</p>

            <p>Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival</p>

            <p>Uncrewed spacecraft or robotic spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input, such as remote control, or remote guidance. </p>

            <p>The first 'true spacecraft' is sometimes said to be Apollo Lunar Module,[22] since this was the only crewed vehicle to have been designed for, and operated only in space; and is notable for its non-aerodynamic shape.</p>
